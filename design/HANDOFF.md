# Week 5 — Handoff notes (SIS 2 starter design)
Routes (from the prototype):  / (home), /posts (posts list) → /posts/:id (one post, "Read more") → "← All posts" back to /posts, /contact, * (404 page, "Back to all posts")
Components → React files:     PostCard → src/components/PostCard.tsx   Button → src/components/ui/Button.tsx   Tag → src/components/ui/Tag.tsx
Button variants → prop:       variant = 'primary' | 'secondary'
PostCard layout:              direction vertical  gap 12px  padding 16px  radius 8px (radius/md), fill color/surface, stroke 1px color/border
Breakpoint change:            phone 1 column(s), desktop 3 columns; header stacked on phone, one row on desktop (gap 24px, padding 24px / 16px)
Tokens (all ten):             color/primary = #1D4ED8  color/on-primary = #FFFFFF  color/text = #1F2937  color/text-muted = #9CA3AF (fails 4.5:1 on white, fixed to #6B7280 in code)  color/surface = #FFFFFF  color/border = #D1D5DB  space/2 = 8  space/4 = 16  space/6 = 24  radius/md = 8
